# Botbowl MCTS-bot

This library contains an implementation for an MCTS algorithm that can play the game of botbowl as required for the second assignment of the Modern Game AI course of the University of Leiden. The implementation of MCTS can be found in MGAI.py, the MCTS-opp.py file is used for MCTS opponents and the other files are results achieved from our experiments.

## Installation

This implementation requires the installation of the game of botbowl, as presented by Njustesen on Github, please follow the installation steps [from their Github page](https://njustesen.github.io/botbowl/). After installing the library, one can now use MGAI.py to run a botbowl game with the MCTS agent. If there are any issues with running the script, make sure to install the required libraries and if issues persist, try moving the python file to the botbowl/examples folder.

## Usage

After installing the required libraries, please adapt and run the MGAI.py file to use the implementation. If the MCTS agent is used as an opponent in the botbowl game, it is best practice to import the agent from MCTS-opp.py rather than MGAI.py. This implementation is an assignment for the Modern Game AI course of the Univeristy of Leiden. Please keep in mind that this implementation is not flawless.
